  abstract = {Animal movement, spanning all time and space scales in nature, is constrained by the individual's available energy to spend, creating a strong link between physiology and observed movement and distribution patterns. To progress, movement ecology needs an explicit focus on common mechanisms, such as energetics, linking behaviour to fitness consequences across scales, but simplified by process-based approaches, such as individual-based models (IBMs). We review the animal movement literature, from fine-scale patch foraging to large-scale geographic migration, focussing on IBMs incorporating individual energetics (hereafter termed eIBMs). The literature shows IBMs in movement ecology are mainly defined by the following four categories nested across different space and time scales: (1) fine-scale displacement, i.e. foraging and local habitat selection by animals under different resource availabilities, including (2) cognitive processes, such as risk perception, memory and learning, (3) home range occupancy and dispersal potential, and (4) migration and biogeographic distribution. Amongst eIBMs, a common issue emerges: individual traits like energetics are sometimes species- and problem-specific, leading to divergence in the way energetics are incorporated and aggregated in the models. Further, movement becomes more difficult to predict with increasing time and space scales and behaviour and biological complexity. Using this individual-level approach, we show 1) it is most effective in explaining fine-scale movement (foraging and competition) where the links between the animal and their habitat are immediate and absolute compared to coarser time and space scales, 2) coarser time and space scales present further challenges for the animal that require more careful interpretation of movement drivers, and 3) common, but more complex behaviours across scales, such as risk perception and memory, are better explained with richer ecological data that are well-integrated into movement models. We propose formulating individual energetics in a modelling framework as a next-gen extension to address the challenges of modelling movement across different scales, species, and constraints.},

  abstract = {The increasing use of computer simulation modelling brings with it epistemological questions about the possibilities and limits of its use for understanding spatio-temporal dynamics of social and environmental systems. These questions include how we learn from simulation models and how we most appropriately explain what we have learnt. Generative simulation modelling provides a framework to investigate how the interactions of individual heterogeneous entities across space and through time produce system-level patterns. This modelling approach includes individual- and agent-based models and is increasingly being applied to study environmental and social systems, and their interactions with one another. Much of the formally presented analysis and interpretation of this type of simulation resorts to statistical summaries of aggregated, system-level patterns. Here, we argue that generative simulation modelling can be recognised as being ‘event-driven’, retaining a history in the patterns produced via simulated events and interactions. Consequently, we explore how a narrative approach might use this simulated history to better explain how patterns are produced as a result of model structure, and we provide an example of this approach using variations of a simulation model of breeding synchrony in bird colonies. This example illustrates not only why observed patterns are produced in this particular case, but also how generative simulation models function more generally. Aggregated summaries of emergent system-level patterns will remain an important component of modellers’ toolkits, but narratives can act as an intermediary between formal descriptions of model structure and these summaries. Using a narrative approach should help generative simulation modellers to better communicate the process by which they learn so that their activities and results can be more widely interpreted. In turn, this will allow non-modellers to foster a fuller appreciation of the function and benefits of generative simulation modelling.},

  abstract = {Plant species models are among the available tools to predict the future of ecosystems threatened by climate change, habitat loss, and degradation. However, they suffer from low to no inclusion of plant dispersal, which is necessary to predict ecosystem evolution. A variety of seed dispersal models have been conceived for anemochorous and zoochorous plant species, but the coupling between vegetation models and seed dispersal processes remains rare. The main challenge in modelling zoochoric dispersal is simulating animal movements in their complex habitat. Recent developments allow straightforward applications of hidden Markov modelling (HMM) to animal movements, which could ease generalizations when modelling zoochoric seed dispersal. We tested the use of HMM to model seed dispersal by an endangered primate in the Brazilian Atlantic forest, to demonstrate its potential simplicity to simulate seed dispersal processes. We also discuss how to adapt it to other species. We collected information on movement, fruit consumption, deposition, and habitat use of Leontopithecus chrysomelas. We analysed daily trajectories using HMM and built a deterministic Model Of Seed Transfer (MOST), which replicated, with good approximation, the primate’s movement and seed deposition patterns as observed in the field. Our results suggest that the dispersal behaviour and short daily-trajectories of L. chrysomelas restrict the species’ role in large-scale forest regeneration, but contribute to the prevalence of resource tree species locally, and potentially maintaining tree diversity by preventing local extinction. However, it may be possible to accurately simulate dispersal in an area, without necessarily quantifying variables that influence movement, if the movement can be broken down to step-length and turning angles, and parametrised along with the distribution of gut-transit times. For future objectives, coupling MOST with a DVM could be used to test hypotheses on tree species survival in various scenarios, simulating regeneration and growth at regional scales by including data on main dispersal agents over the area of interest, distribution of tree species, and land use data. The principal advantage of the MOST model is its functionality with data available from the literature as the variables are easy to parametrise. We suggest using the coupled model to perform experiments using only available information, but varying the numbers and species of seed dispersers, or modifying land cover or configuration to test for possible thresholds preventing the extinction of selected tree species.},

  abstract = {Abstract Most animals live in home ranges, and memory is thought to be an important process in their formation. However, a general memory-based model for characterising and predicting home range emergence has been lacking. Here, we use a mechanistic movement model to: (1) quantify the role of memory in the movements of a large mammal reintroduced into a novel environment, and (2) predict observed patterns of home range emergence in this experimental setting. We show that an interplay between memory and resource preferences is the primary process influencing the movements of reintroduced roe deer (Capreolus capreolus). Our memory-based model fitted with empirical data successfully predicts the formation of home ranges, as well as emergent properties of movement and spatial revisitation observed in the reintroduced animals. These results provide a mechanistic framework for combining memory-based movements, resource preferences, and the formation of home ranges in nature.},

  abstract = {Seed dispersal is a critical ecological function provided largely by vertebrate frugivores in tropical forests. The seed dispersal events mediated by a frugivore species depend on the interaction between the frugivore's traits and landscape structure. Managers seeking to restore seed dispersal to degraded areas to facilitate passive regeneration must consider these interactions. We explore how the relationship between disperser traits and landscape configuration affects seed rain patterns by assessing two restoration goals: 1) high native seed dispersal into degraded areas and 2) low non-native seed dispersal into intact areas. We developed an individual-based, spatially-explicit model, ‘Estimating Seed-Animal-Landscape Interactions' (eSALI), and applied it to the case study of Guam, a tropical island that experienced near-total loss of animal-mediated seed dispersal following extirpation of its vertebrate frugivores. We focus on two frugivorous bird species, såli Aplonis opaca and totot Ptilinopus roseicapilla, both candidates for rewilding on Guam but differ in their movement distances, gut passage times and habitat use. We simulated populations of both species in seven theoretical landscapes. These landscapes varied in the spatial configuration of intact and degraded forest patches, hosting native and non-native plant species, respectively. Our results showed that seed rain pattern of the two frugivore species differed across scenarios. A clear tradeoff appeared between both restoration goals in all scenarios: while Såli moved overall more native seeds into degraded areas, they also moved more non-native seeds into intact areas. Totot on the contrary minimized non-native seed into intact areas at the expense of moving overall fewer native seeds in degraded areas. This tradeoff was also correlated to landscape configuration: lower heterogeneity minimized non-native seed rain into intact patches while higher heterogeneity maximized native seed rain into degraded patches. Land managers should explore the interactions between dispersers and landscape configuration to identify ideal candidates for restoring ecological functions.},

We examined ranging behavior and space use to evaluate the potential for territoriality in five groups of red titi monkeys (Plecturocebus discolor) during a 10-year study in Ecuadorian Amazonia. Mean home range size, calculated using a time-sensitive local convex hull estimation procedure, was 4.0\,±\,1.4\,ha. Annual home ranges of neighboring groups overlapped, on average, 0\%–7\%. Mean daily path length was 670\,±\,194\,m, resulting in defendability indices of 2.2–3.6 across groups. Groups visited, on average, 4 of 12 sections of their home range border area per day, but that was not more often than would be expected by chance, and intergroup encounters were infrequent. We did not find evidence of active monitoring for intruders in border areas, in that groups did not travel either faster or slower when at the border than when in central areas of their range. The absence of overt monitoring might be compensated for by engaging in loud calls, which the study groups did throughout their home ranges; these calls may serve as an advertisement of occupancy and a deterrent to intruding conspecifics. Our finding that red titis have a high potential for territoriality is consistent with several of the main hypotheses proposed to explain pair-living in mammals.},
