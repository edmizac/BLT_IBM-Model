# BLT---IBM-Model

* Current version: v1.2 (check branch)
* Some data are still not available (required for model runs)


The project is entitled "Predicting seed shadows in different environmental contexts: a modelling approach applied to an arboreal frugivore". It is the Master's project of Eduardo Miguel Zanette (UNESP-Rio Claro) and aims at:
1) Validating an agent-based model (ABM) of seed dispersal by black-lion-tamarins (BLT, Leontopithecus chrysopygus)
2) Simulate seed shadows in different environmental contexts (different patch sizes, shapes and resource distributions)
