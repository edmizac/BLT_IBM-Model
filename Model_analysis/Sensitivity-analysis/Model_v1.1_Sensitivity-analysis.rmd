  This document was produced for reporting the first well succeeded sensitivity (Morris screening method) analysis of the BLT Model with the nlrx package. We used the Guare√≠ environment with resources from July. The parameters varied were (and can be checked on the "Model_v1.1_2022-07-14d.R" file in Sensitivity-Analysis folder):
    
  # memory
  "step_forget" = list(min=1, max = 100, step = 10, qfun="qunif"),
  "visual" = list(min=1, max = 3, step = 1, qfun="qunif"),
  "prop_trees_to_reset_memory" = list(min = 1, max = 8, step = 1, qfun="qunif"),
                              
  # movement
  "p-foraging-while-traveling" = list(min = 0.1, max = 0.6, step = 0.1, qfun="qunif"), 
  "duration" = list(min=1, max = 6, step = 2, qfun="qunif")
   
   We also ran these values for phenology "on" and "off".
