### Read empirical tree files
```{r}
treepath <- here("Data", "Movement", "Resource-trees")
trees <- read.csv(paste0(treepath, "/", "Siminputrow_trees.csv"),
                           sep = ",", dec = ".", stringsAsFactors = TRUE) #%>% 
  # mutate(group = recode(group, "Guarei" = "Guare√≠")) # to match all other datasets

# feeding_trees_gua <- read.csv()
# sleeping_trees_gua <- read.csv()

```

### Plot some examples
```{r}
ggplot(db) +
  geom_point(data = subset(db, breed == "seeds"), 
             aes(x = x_UTM, y = y_UTM, color = species, shape = `disp-day`)) + #https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60817705/filtering-values-in-ggplot2
  geom_point(data = feeding_trees_gua,
             aes(x = x_UTM, y = y_UTM, color = species, shape = `disp-day`)) +
  geom_point(data = sleeping_trees_gua,
             aes(x = x_UTM, y = y_UTM, color = species, shape = `disp-day`))

ggplot(subset(db, study_area == "Taquara" | `feeding-trees-scenario` == "Jan" | `random-seed` == 	2106024157)) +
  geom_point(data = subset(db, breed == "seeds"), 
             aes(x = x_UTM, y = y_UTM, color = species, shape = `disp-day`)) #+ #https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60817705/filtering-values-in-ggplot2
